# By default, this crate allows also underscores ('_') in FQDN
# and has greater length limits than the RFC allows but
# domain labels canâ€™t start or end with hyphens
default = [ "domain-label-cannot-start-or-end-with-hyphen" ]

# Activate all the features to conform to all RFC
# RFC1035 accepts only digits, letters and '-' in FQDN, labels are 1 to 63 chars long,
#         max length of FQDN including null label is 255 chars (i.e. 253 visible chars)
# RFC952: labels cannot start or end with hyphens
# RFC1123: labels can start with numbers (so there is no limitation about digit positions)
